\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for 
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 a\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 ll its users.  The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, n\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ot price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces 
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 o\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 f it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain respons\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2  software.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that w
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 hat they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it ma\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
y be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim o
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 r\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2  with modifications.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriat\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
e copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Prog
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 r\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 am.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 the following:

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your optio
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 n\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 ).
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appr
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
opriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     d\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 ) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or d\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 istribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 abo\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ve provided that you also do one of the following:
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     b) accompany it with a written offer, vali\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
d for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2     c\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 So\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
urce code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2  \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or tr\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ansfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this Li
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 c\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ense.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2  Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a lic\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ense from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   7. The Free Software Foundation may p\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ublish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 Each version is given a distinguishing v\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ersion number.  If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software F
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 o\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 undation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditi\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ons are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals o
\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 f\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2  preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES O

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   If you dev\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
elop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2   To do so, attach the following notices to the prog\hich\af2\dbch\af18\loch\f2 
ram.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
